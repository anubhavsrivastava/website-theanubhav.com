~~I frequently get questions about different tech stuff I use.~~ Actually, no one cares enough to ask me what I use 😂. But never the less, here is list of stuff that fits my daily routine and requirement.

Inspired by [awesome-use](https://github.com/wesbos/awesome-uses). 😊

Over the years (and couple of decades), my preferred platform for software development has gone through several drastic iterations. When I first started playing around with software development around 2006, I was using Pentium IV powered Machine as my primary computer along with TurboC Editor as my code editor of choice, since I was only working on C. As development environment was/isgoing through an evolutionary cycle, so has the languages that I use for coding. When I started out I worked primarily in C before switching to using mostly JavaScript/Typescript. I also had short stint with PHP, C# and Python.
