ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I am Anubhav Srivastava. Currently, I am in Berlin, Germany.I am Front-end Developer, writer in my spare time, tech addicted, open-source lover.

I also have interest in User Experience, UI design, Web standards, and accessibility to create meanful and usable interactions,

I love to talk about front-end development.

You can subscribe to monthly [newsletter](/newletter) about Frontend an Web ecosystem.
Additionally, I also run another newsletter - [Devtips](devtips.substack.com) about variety of technical tips for Web developers. Each tip is quick and to the point, describing a problem and one or more ways to solve that problem. I don't expect every tip to be useful to every developer, but I hope you'll find enough of them valuable to make listening worth your time.

You may contact at [me@theanubhav.com](mailto:me@theanubhav.com)

Please keep it short and avoid support/help messages.
