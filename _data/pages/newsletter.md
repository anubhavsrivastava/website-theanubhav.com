I love to talk about front-end and web development.

You can subscribe to [newsletter](https://buttondown.email/theanubhav) about Frontend and Web ecosystem. It is compilation of web related stuff and development in Frontend ecosystem and resources around it.

Additionally, I also run another newsletter - [Devtips](devtips.substack.com) about variety of technical tips for Web developers. Each tip is quick and to the point, describing a problem and one or more ways to solve that problem. I don't expect every tip to be useful to every developer, but I hope you'll find enough of them valuable to make listening worth your time.
